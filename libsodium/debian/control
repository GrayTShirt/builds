Description: Modern cryptography library
 Sodium is a modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption,
 signatures, password hashing and more. It is a portable, cross-compilable,
 installable, packageable fork of NaCl, with a compatible API, and an extended
 API to improve usability even further. Its goal is to provide all of the core
 operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.
 .
 Sodium supports a variety of compilers and operating systems, including Windows
 (with MinGW or Visual Studio, x86 and x64), iOS and Android. The design choices
 emphasize security, and "magic constants" have clear rationales. And despite the
 emphasis on high security, primitives are faster across-the-board than most
 implementations of the NIST standards.
