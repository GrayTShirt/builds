Description: Distributed Messaging
 ZeroMQ (also known as ØMQ, 0MQ, or zmq) looks like an embeddable networking
 library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry
 atomic messages across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP,
 and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fan-out,
 pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the
 fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable
 multicore applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has
 a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems. ZeroMQ is from
 iMatix and is LGPLv3 open source.
