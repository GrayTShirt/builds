Description: time-series data storage and display system (programs)
 RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will not
 expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data to
 enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put a friendly user interface on it.

Package: rrdcached
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: data caching daemon for RRDtool
 rrdcached is a daemon that receives updates to existing RRD files,
 accumulates them and, if enough have been received or a defined time has
 passed, writes the updates to the RRD file.  The daemon was written with
 big setups in mind which usually runs into I/O related problems.  This
 daemon was written to alleviate these problems.

Description: time-series data storage and display system (Perl interface, shared)
 The Round Robin Database Tool (RRDtool) is a system to store and display
 time-series data (e.g. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in Round Robin Databases (RRDs),
 a very compact way that will not expand over time. RRDtool processes the
 extracted data to enforce a certain data density, allowing for useful
 graphical representation of data values.
 .
 This package contains a Perl interface to RRDs using a shared library.

 server load average). It stores the data in Round Robin Databases (RRDs),
 a very compact way that will not expand over time. RRDtool processes the
 extracted data to enforce a certain data density, allowing for useful
 graphical representation of data values.
 .
 This package contains a Perl interface to RRDs using command pipes.
